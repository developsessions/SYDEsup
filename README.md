# SYDEsup

[![Build](https://github.com/developsessions/SYDEsup/actions/workflows/build.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/developsessions/SYDEsup/actions/workflows/build.yml)

SYDEsup by [STW](https://www.stw-mobile-machines.com/) is a console application for updating the STW ECUs with a Service Update Package created with openSYDE GUI.

SYDEsup is normally delivered directly as a Windows build from STW, but sometimes its necessary to transfer the application from an Linux OS.

This is why I created this project which helps to continuous and periodically build SYDEsup for the following targets:
- Linux Debian / Ubuntu
- Alpine Linux
- Windows

We are holding no source code here, we're pull the code from the [official repository](https://github.com/openSYDE/openSYDE).
